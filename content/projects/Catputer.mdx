**Catputer** is a relaxing shelter for the cat when the owner is working with their laptop. It is heated up softly, and when you open this product like the laptop, it automatically plays with the cat with randomly moving light, and the owner and the cat can contact the eyes across the handle.

## üí¨¬†How it works

This product is divided into two main parts. 

-   A heating pad that transfers heat to the bottom
-   A handle with lighting effects 

When you turn on the switch on the back, heat rises from under the cushion to warm the whole body. As the process of opening a laptop, you can hold the handle and open the catputer to turn on the lighting effect.
Cats can sit and rest on a warm pad when the heating pad is on. When the owner opens the laptop and opens the catputer at the same time, the cat can have a good time on the catputer while the owner is working on the laptop instead of distracting the owners‚Äô work.
