## 📝 About the Project

Topic: **Synaesthesia**

I aimed to make **projective voice visualizer** that can be applied as identifier of person from the inspiration of “personality to color” translative property of the synaesthesia. 

- `p5.js`, `p5.sound`

**Inspiration** of this project and possible application in real context has been demonstrated in this video.

**Demo video of implemented VOURA**. 

When the user talks, this projective VOURA changes its color. After initialization time, it fixed with certain color and size.

## 💬 How it works

After high-pass filtering of voice, I analyzed it with FFT. Several data from the result is used in conversion from voice to aura.
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Voice</th>
      <th>Aura</th>
      <th>Conversion</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Tone</td>
      <td>Hue of color</td>
      <td>higher centroid → colder color</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Pitch</td>
      <td>Saturation of color</td>
      <td>lower <em>maxFreq</em> → more saturated color</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Intonation</td>
      <td>Range of size</td>
      <td>larger range of <em>maxFreq</em> → larger range of size</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Volume</td>
      <td>Evg. size</td>
      <td>larger average of <em>maxFreq</em> → larger size</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

- centroid = center of mass of FFT result
- *maxFreq* = the frequency level that has maximum volume in FFT result

## ✍️ What I learn

🏃‍♀️**First experience of design sprint**

I had to follow whole process of design from brainstorming to implementation for 5 days. I learnt that it is most **important to select a suitable project concept scale with the time limit.**

✨ **Finding values** 

This project did not begin from the problem definition as usual design projects. The process of finding values of it and match the application context was worth it.
