## 📝 About the Project

![사진 1.jpg](/img/proj_door_1.jpg)

> **Design project** from KAIST ID403 System Design **coursework** (Department of Industrial Design)

PlinDoor digitally augments a conventional room door to facilitate communication between people at both sides. Users can **control PlinDoor's openness** and express their moods by **folding, cutting, and making virtual holes** as they do with real paper.

## ✍️ What I learn

💬 **Communication research**

It was the first time that I’ve designed and researched about the **technology/system mediated communication** in **offline** environment. While conducting 3 different user tests to develop the design, I can understand the difference between ordinary UI design and system design like this project.

🗣️ **How to convince audience of my design**

After we decided to use door for enhancing communication between family member, there were several concept changes because of setting too ambitious goal comparing with the project scale. I learnt that wrapping the design more attractive and convincing is important as well as the contents itself.
