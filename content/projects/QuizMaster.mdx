## 📝 About the Project

![Screen Capture of QuizMaster](/pubs/pub_quizmaster.png)

In higher education, multiple choice questions are an efficient and objective assessment method.
Beyond simply answering questions, **self-generated quiz activities serve as active learning and self-directed learning for adult learners**, helping them think strategically about what is important to remember or take away from the course materials.
Consequently, recent studies have explored learner-sourcing methods through student participation in MCQ generation.
However, in actual classes, ensuring quality of MCQ is challenging, and grading these questions can become an additional burden for instructors, making such approaches difficult to adopt.

To support the evaluation of MCQs, this LLM-based service provides comprehensive **feedback on students' MCQs**—covering from grammar and typos to simulated difficulty—and enables them to easily **share their questions with peers**.
