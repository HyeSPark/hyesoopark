## ✍️ What I learn

📓 **User diary study**

It was first time that I conducted the user diary study. For 3 people, 5 days diary study, I had to prepare a lot and manage the diary everyday. While analyzing the result, I’d got **several fresh insight from the participants’ diary**. It was valuable experience for me.

🌦 **In-depth UI design**

Since this project was supported for award, we had to do some additional works after the course is finished. Therefore, there was enough time to finalize the UI and improve design quality. I think its completeness is better than the normal class assignments.
