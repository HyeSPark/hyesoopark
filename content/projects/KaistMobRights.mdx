> **Side Project**

For the event of human rights committee, I designed and developed the mobile web app that offers information of the current status of mobility facilities for impaired people in KAIST Campus. 

The design aimed to be intuitive to get the information of the building, and lead users to be interested in mobility rights.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

- `React.js`, `Google API`

## 💬 How it works

Google Sheets that only committee members can access is linked as the database, so the maintenance and update is simple.

← Poster’s quote: *“Are **people with visual impairment** accessible to **N13-1**(number of the building)?”*

Posters similar as left have been distributed several buildings in KAIST Campus. If the user scan the QR code, they can directly access in the building page (3rd screen capture in heroshot above) and **get the information of building accessibility for impaired person.**

If there is no data collected for that building, the page offers google form link for report. This is participatory project with KAIST students, so it is designed to **encourage participation of KAIST students**.

There are pages for explaining project aim and facility glossary, for searching building.

## ✍️ What I learn

👥 **Develop service for unspecified people**

Before this project, I used to implement services for the user experiment. The target was unspecified people in this project and even I aimed to let people participate, I considered about **UX that could attract more attraction from users.**

👩🏻‍💻 **Usage of Google API** 

The database was constructed in Google Sheets before I began the project. I was new to using Google API to get the data, but I learnt to connect the database with the website.
