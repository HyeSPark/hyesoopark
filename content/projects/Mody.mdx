> _What happens to our society when activists disappear due to psychological burnout?_

[According to a preliminary survey conducted on human rights activists](https://amazingcenter.kr/52/?idx=12962470&bmode=view), the percentage of activists at risk of psychological health issues‚Äîsuch as depression, obsessive-compulsive tendencies, interpersonal sensitivity, and anxiety‚Äîis significantly higher compared to the national adult average. The main causes are frequent burnout due to a lack of personnel and high workloads. Psychological support and continuous monitoring of mental health are essential for activists.

Therefore, we built an mobile app to facilitate daily self-care of activists and also social support from peers.

## Project Details

### Interview to Understand Target Users

- üë§ **Interview Subjects**: Six participants with over six months of social activism experience (including university human rights organization activists, social workers, and alternative school educators, with an average of two years of experience) and who have undergone psychological counseling.
- üìÑ **Interview Format**: 40-minute semi-structured interviews.
- üíì **Interview Findings**:
    1. The psychological and emotional toll of social activism is significantly greater compared to everyday activities.
    2. Activists are deeply affected by societal oppression factors such as subtle discrimination and hate speech, but existing psychological counseling services or diary apps do not consider this social context.
    3. Activists need a space where they can connect with each other and share thoughts on mental health.

### Values and Key Features

> _Let‚Äôs gather activists who light their own torches to create an warm bonfire that will not burn out!_

#### 1. Light Your Torch üî•

- This feature allows users to record activities and the emotions related to them. While the "activity" primarily targets social activism such as hosting booth events, attending human rights seminars, and participating in marches, the design allows for the inclusion of everyday activities as well. Through this recording process, users can reflect on their emotions and reconsider their feelings associated with these activities.
- ‚ú® **Related Service Components**: `Record Tab`
- üí≠ **Expected Effect**: _Awareness of personal emotions related to social activism_

#### 2. Examine Your Torch üîé

- This feature provides simplified psychological tests and statistics that compile the test results and recorded emotions. It offers users an opportunity to reflect on their mental state and various social activities and emotions they‚Äôve documented.
- ‚ú® **Related Service Components**: `My Records Tab`, `Psychological Test Tab`, `Activities Tab <Self-Care Kit>`
- üí≠ **Expected Effect**: _Enhanced self-awareness and coping through understanding everyday psychological states_

#### 3. Share Your Torch ü§ù

- When users choose to make their social activity records public, they can appear on a leaderboard along with the number of people engaged in the same activity, allowing others to offer support.
- ‚ú® **Related Service Components**: `Activities Tab <Together>`
- üí≠ **Expected Effect**: _Strengthening of social and emotional support_
